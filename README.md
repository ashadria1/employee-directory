## Description
🔍 For this project, I have created an employee directory with React.  This project will require a user to break up their application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

* Sort the table by at least one category

* Filter the users by at least one property.
